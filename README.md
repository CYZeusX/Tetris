    - able to play on both orientation                                                >> potrait | landscape
    - blocks can be emojis, letters, symbols, or even sentence(NOT Recommended)!
    - can change the blocks of the game                                               >> because the blocks formed with symbols (String)
    - can change the particles of the background                                      >> because the background forms with symbols (char)
    - has shoulder buttons, can use index figers to rotate blocks

    
### Purpose
    it is totally for personal uses
    
    Q&A: Why not just download one on app store?
         - Because I have high demand. 
         - I have found LACK OF FEATURES on most of the Tetris games on Android.
                > lack of blocks anti-clockwise rotation
                > lack of landscape orientation mode
                > lack of immersive experience (vibration)
