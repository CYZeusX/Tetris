### Purpose
    it is totally for personal uses
    
    (Why not just download one on app store?)
        Because I have high demand. 
        I have found LACK OF FEATURES on most of the Tetris games on Android.
    > lack of blocks anti-clockwise rotation
    > lack of landscape orientation mode

### * Incommensurably Innovative Features
    - able to play on both orientation    >> potrait | landscape
    - can change the blocks of the game   >> because the blocks uses char for the shapes
    - has shoulder buttons, can use index figers to rotate blocks
    
### * Comming soon features
    - light|dark mode
    - supports controllers  >> testing with: ROG Tessen , RAZER Kishi Ultra
    - background music
    - audio effect

### * Working on
    - pause menu
    - resume
    - restart
    - quit app
    - setting menu
    - change light|dark mode
    - custom char for blocks
    - return default char for blocks
    - save block for later
    - 3 next following blocks
    - sync monitor between potrait and landscape mode
    - ~~block shadow~~

### * Completed features / fixes
- fixed blocks unaligned with monitor
- fixed freezed "Tetris!" effect when triggered the second time
- Implemented block shadow
- Implemented "Tetris!" effect when cleared 4 rows at once
- Implemented "Tetris!" effect with vibration
