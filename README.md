# HONEST DISCLAIMER:  NOT quite the result of my knowledge. (AI contributed a LOT)
### IMPORTANT: meant for Android ONLY
---

### Purpose
    - is totally for personal uses
    
    *Why build a tetris game to play yourself?*
    - because I have high demand. The ordinary Tetris game on mobile I have found is **LACK OF FEATURES**.
    > lack of blocks anti-clockwise rotation
    > lack of landscape orientation mode

### * Incommensurably Innovative Features
    - able to play on both orientation    >> potrait | landscape
    - can change the blocks of the game   >> because the blocks uses char to for the shapes
    - has shoulder buttons, can use index figers to rotate blocks
    
### * Comming soon features
    - light|dark mode
    - supports controllers  >> testing with: ROG Tessen , RAZER Kishi Ultra
    - background music

### * Working on
    - pause menu
    - resume
    - restart
    - quit app
    - setting menu
    - change light|dark mode
    - change char for blocks
    - return to default char of the blocks
    - save block for later
    - 3 next following blocks
    - block shadow
