### Purpose
    it is totally for personal uses,
    and making it as perfect as possible AT ALL COST
    
    Q&A: Why not just download one on app store?
         - Because I have high demand. 
         - I have found LACK OF FEATURES on most of the Tetris games on Android.
                > lack of blocks anti-clockwise rotation
                > lack of landscape orientation mode
                > lack of immersive experience (vibration)
